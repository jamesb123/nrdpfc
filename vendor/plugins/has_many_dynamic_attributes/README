= RUNNING UNIT TESTS

== Creating the test database

The test databases will be created from the info specified in test/database.yml.
Either change that file to match your database or change your database to
match that file.

== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. By default sqlite3
will be the database run. Just change your env variable DB to be the database
adaptor (specified in database.yml) that you want to use. The database and
permissions must already be setup but the tables will be created for you
from schema.rb.
